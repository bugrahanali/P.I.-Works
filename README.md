# User Management Screen UI Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the user interface requirements and specifications for the User Management Screen. The interface allows for viewing and managing user accounts within a system.

## UI Components
### User List Table
- **Columns**: ID, User Name, Email, Enabled (with sorting capability on each column)
- **Rows**: Display a list of users with their respective ID, username, email, and enabled status.
- **Hide Disabled User**: A toggle switch that filters out disabled users from the list when activated.

### New User Form
- **Username**: A mandatory text field for entering a new username.
- **Display Name**: An optional text field for entering the user's display name.
- **Phone**: An optional text field for entering the user's phone number.
- **Email**: A mandatory text field for entering the user's email address.
- **User Roles**: A dropdown to select one or multiple user roles (Guest, Admin, Super-Admin).
- **Enabled**: A checkbox to indicate whether the user account is active upon creation.

### Buttons
- **New User**: To reset the form and prepare to input a new user.
- **Save User**: To save the new user's data into the system.

## Behavior and Functionality
- **Initial Load**: When the page loads, all users are listed in the table.
- **Sort Feature**: Clicking on a column header sorts the table by that column.
- **Filter Feature**: The 'Hide Disabled User' toggle, when switched on, will immediately filter out users with 'Enabled' set to false.
- **Form Validation**: Form fields will be validated for correct data formats before submission.
- **Role Selection**: User roles can be selected from the dropdown and the chosen role(s) will be displayed as tags within the field.
- **Creation of New Users**:
  - Upon clicking 'New User', the form resets and is ready for input.
  - The 'Save User' button is disabled until all mandatory fields are filled and validated.
- **Saving New Users**:
  - Clicking 'Save User' sends the data to the server.
  - If successful, the new user is added to the table and the user is notified of the successful addition.
  - If there's an error, the user is notified and remains on the form to correct the data.

## UI Requirements
- **Responsive Design**: The UI must be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: UI components should be accessible, with proper ARIA labels where applicable.
- **Error Handling**: Informative error messages should be displayed for invalid inputs or failed operations.
- **Confirmation Messages**: Upon successful operations, a confirmation message should be displayed to the user.

## Technical Considerations
- **API Integration**: The front-end must properly integrate with the back-end API for fetching and updating user data.
- **Security**: Ensure that all user data is handled securely and in compliance with GDPR and other data protection laws.
- **Testing**: The interface should be thoroughly tested across different browsers and devices.
